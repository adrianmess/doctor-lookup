## Description
A website where users can enter a medical condition or the name of a Doctor and list of the top 10 Doctors that match the search criteria will be shown. The data returned will contain the name, contact information, business address and a link to their website if one is available.

* Search results are limited to a 25 mile radius of Portland, OR.

This website utilizes the [BetterDoctor API](https://developer.betterdoctor.com/) for retrieval of provider data.
